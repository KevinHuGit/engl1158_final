        <p className={styles.body}>
          Throughout this semester, a theme that has captured my attention is the competing forces of wilderness and modernization, with the train acting as a bridge between the two. To explore this theme, I thought about how railroads visualize this balance and the broader implications of two forces fighting against each other. I recognized that at its basic function, trains move people from one place to another through nature that would otherwise prevent that movement. From this realization, I determined that “kinetic” was a word relating to railroads and dynamic enough to explore this balance between human-designed motion and natural forces.
          <br /><br />
          The definition of kinetic is “relating to or resulting from motion” which I often think of in the context of kinetic energy. Kinetic energy, in a physical sense, represents the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. However, beyond physics, kinetic energy can extend metaphorically to encompass many dynamic objects— moving through space, time, or society.
          <br /><br />
          The curation of this exhibit focuses on the way kinetic energy is displayed through humans and how nature often interacts with that display. Countless examples appear everyday, including vehicles, institutions, or the human body itself. Here are just a few interpretations of the word “kinetic” that are related to the topic of trains. The growth of railroads in the US can be described as kinetic, rapidly gaining pace through the 18th and 19th centuries. Kinetic could also describe the turbulent and shifting dynamics of migrant workers who built railroads in the US, such as the inflow and outflow of Chinese workers (which will be explored later in this exhibit). Finally, kinetic describes the motion of trains themselves, symbolized as unstoppable vehicles and a representation of forward motion. Just through the railroad, we can parse three interpretations of kinetic, while the goal of this exhibit is to explore those interpretations further.
          <br /><br />
          In my exhibit, I delve into the representation of kinetic energy within four objects ranging from movies, texts, art pieces, and technology. Each object presents a different definition of “Kinetic” that resonates with the themes of movement, transformation, and dynamism within the world. However, they complement each other in accepting that with all forms of motion, there is a balance struck, either with nature, with other humans, or with some other force. Each work also displays where their kinetic energy comes from, whether from nature, by human invention, from societal pressures, accidental or intentional purposes, or even the absence of motion.
          <br /><br />
          One related theme explored in this exhibit is a correlation between modernization and human control of this “kinetic” force. Film is a powerful example, where technology allows us to capture movement through a lens and use it to excite, entertain, or inform people thousands of miles away. As film technology advanced through the years, filmmakers demonstrated techniques to make films even more “kinetic”. We went from displaying single-shot action in <i>The Great Train Robbery</i> (1903) to Tom Cruise riding a motorcycle off a cliff in <i>Mission Impossible</i> (2023). To assess this correlation further, the order in which this exhibit is arranged intentionally traverses objects from older events to newer ones, replicating the linear motion of human advancements. As we progress through time, the conflict between human-made kinetic and naturally occurring kinetic energy increases, highlighting the heightened control that humans demand over the concept of “kinetic”. However, each of the objects also reminds us that we are limited by the capabilities of nature, even as we make technological advancements.
          <br /><br />
          “Kinetic” has many interpretations that are very human-controlled, manifesting as social movements, historical events, movies, art, and technology. This "kinetic", however, is balanced by natural forces, limiting our control of movement both physically and abstractly.

            Object 1: "The Grandfather of the Sierra Nevada Mountains" by Maxine Hong Kingston
          </h3>

          <p className={styles.quote}>
            While the demons posed for photographs, the China Men dispersed. It was dangerous to stay. The Driving Out had begun. [...] Seventy went to New Orleans to grade a route for a railroad, then to Pennsylvania to work in a knife factory. The Colorado State Legislature passed a resolution welcoming the railroad China Men to come build the new state. They built railroads in every part of the country—the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad, the Houston and Texas Railroad, the Southern Pacific, the railroads in Louisiana and Boston, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska. After the Civil War, China Men banded the nation North and South, East and West, with crisscrossing steel. They were the binding and building ancestors of this place. Ah Goong would have liked a leisurely walk along the tracks to review his finished handiwork, or to walk east to see the rest of his new country. But instead, Driven Out, he slid down mountains, leapt across valleys and streams, crossed plains, hid sometimes with companions and often alone, and eluded bandits who would hold him up for his railroad pay and shoot him for practice as they shot Injuns and jackrabbits. (Kingston, 145-146)
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p className={styles.body}>
            Kingston’s mixture of imaginative narrative and historical retelling does a powerful job of presenting the chaotic events that followed the completion of the Intercontinental Railway in 1869. As described, the dispersal of Chinese migrants was intensely kinetic, after the stability of the intercontinental railroad had rapidly dissolved, shifting the lives of thousands linked to that construction project. In her historical retelling, Kingston writes on the specific actions that many Chinese had to take, referencing many of the moving parts that made the event unique.
            <br /><br />
            As a textual choice, “Driven Out” is specifically capitalized, to establish this event as a legitimate and unique historical event rather than a regular dispersal. In her passage, Kingston recognizes the actual numbers of migrants who left for different states and what occupations they found. Rooting this narrative in statistics, we can recognize how these kinetic events play into the hierarchy of historical events. The text was also able to express this movement of people through a series of creative descriptions, where Ah Goong “slid down mountains” or “leapt across valleys and streams” as he crossed the US looking for work and escaping his captors. This language expresses the kinetic escape that Ah Goong had to take on while also demonstrating the exhaustive conditions many during this “Driving Out” had to endure. It’s also an example of the wilderness opposing human motion, ironically limiting the travel of someone who had built a railroad for that exact purpose. By using this metaphor, Kingston recognizes that kinetic motion was an important factor in the historical events that occurred, while also demonstrating how movement could be limited by geographical features.
            <br /><br />
            The frenetic dispersal of Chinese migrant workers throughout the US was so kinetic because it was preluded by years of railroad work without end. This buildup of tension was natural, as a result of external forces acting upon these Chinese migrants. Under the instruction of white bosses and within a country that did not respect them, Chinese workers were instruments in a shifting US landscape, both physically and societally. Thus, this object interprets kinetic as a descriptor of history, driven by pressures from racial tensions, economic changes, societal norms, and physical events.

          <h3>Object 2: The General (1926)</h3>
          <p className={styles.body}>
            Buster Keaton’s 1926 silent film <i>The General</i> was a masterful display of physical capabilities and advancements in the use of motion in cinematography. Buster Keaton is well known for his silent movies produced during the 1920s, where he used physical comedy and intensive stunts to great entertainment value. In <i>The General</i>, I have analyzed two scenes. One which epitomizes the physical comedy that Keaton executed so well and another scene which speaks to the spectacle that kinetic motion can create.

          <p className={styles.body}>
            In this particular clip, we see a classic example of physical comedy through Keaton’s exaggerated movements and excellent use of surrounding props. One technique that Buster Keaton utilizes is balancing and unbalancing his actions, which demonstrates his control of kinetic motion within his own body. By setting up beats, for example between his hops on the comical hand-car, he sets up a stopping and starting which makes his actions clearly comedic. He also uses pace to show how his motion is short-lived, with only around 20 seconds of him riding on this hand car before it plummets into the ocean. From this point on, Keaton continues to use kinetic motion as a tool to start and stop comedic timing. He jumps on a bicycle only to fall off, before getting onto a train and making a mess from there. His actions are a clear example of what it looks like when kinetic forces are out of balance, leading to comical results.

            This scene, known famously as the “most expensive shot in silent film history”, explores how kinetic motion can be used to dramatic effect through destruction. During the early age of films, one popular type of media was to simply crash two trains into each other, as witnessed in fairs and exhibitions across the US. The act of crashing two things together has continued to be relevant, especially in modern YouTube videos or stunt movies. However, Keaton was the first to capture the kinetics of such a large-scale real event in a film lens. The context around the setting also has many moving parts (including two armies, cavalry, guns, cannons, and a flowing river), which Keaton purposefully directs together to make a spectacle. In doing so, the viewer is captivated by intensified motion and action, which demonstrates a man-made balance between two moving forces. By utilizing the natural surroundings to exert the kinetic energy from the train and the two armies, he plays into this balancing act of advancing technology and natural phenomena.

            From the 1920s to 1950s, Alexander Calder sculpted several mobiles, including this “Arc of Petals”. These mobiles were kinetic sculptures that moved on the command of surrounding air currents, balanced naturally by weight, surface area, and other calculated metrics. His and many other mobiles embraced movement stemming from natural sources, which made up a part of an overall genre labeled Kinetic Art. Calder pioneered this form of kinetic art, represented most clearly in these suspended sculptures of balanced metal disks connected by delicate wires.
            <br /><br />
            One interpretation of these kinetic pieces is to demonstrate the balance but also the unpredictability of nature. This captures the natural chance and movement coming from everyday elements like wind or water. There is an interesting dichotomy between the natural forces driving this sculpture’s kinetics and the calculated arrangement of metallic objects floating in the sky. Calder studied mechanical engineering in college and clearly understood the physics behind building and balancing objects. Thus, this “natural” force that Calder’s mobiles showed was only possible because of pinpoint calculations and manufacturing.
            <br /><br />
            By meticulously crafting these mobiles, we find an example of human creation accepting the forces of nature, contrasting the theme of wilderness fighting against the railroad. Instead of pitting these forces against each other, Calder manipulates kinetic motion and his mobiles to exist harmoniously, a unique way that engages viewers with natural movement. Thus, Calder embraces the limitations of natural forces on human-built kinetics rather than fighting against them, unlike the railroad and many other inventions.
            <br /><br />
            Calder’s work has also been interpreted as an allegory to a philosophy about humans, that we are driven by our surroundings rather than by individual choice. Wilderness and nature still dominate our world, dictating how skyscrapers are engineered, trains are designed, and sculptures are balanced. This connects to the kinetics defined in Kingston’s China Men, where human interaction and social dynamics dictated the motion of thousands of Chinese migrants. However, even within that narrative, the lands migrants crossed and the stars they followed were bound by nature. Therefore, Calder’s pieces remind us that the kinetics of nature are constantly influencing us and our surroundings, even on a societal scale.

            Kinetic energy by definition is the form of energy that is possessed due to its motion. One of the most advanced visualizations of this energy is Maglev trains, which use magnetic force to levitate and propel trains at speeds and stability beyond any modern counterparts. Kinetic energy is a key component in maintaining this motion, where after the train is magnetically lifted, electrical energy is converted to kinetic energy to reach speeds upwards of 350 mph. An interesting use of kinetic energy is within regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy as a train slows. This process allows Maglev trains to be more energy efficient, even more so than they already are, lessening the natural limitations of energy and friction.
            <br /><br />
            The physical properties of magnetism and propulsion are all rooted in nature but have been manipulated to the point of modern innovation. Thus, Maglev trains represent the peak of human control over natural “kinetics”, far beyond the initial stages of train construction when humans first challenged nature. However, these technologies are still held back by the natural limits of friction, environmental impacts, and particularly human pushback.
            <br /><br />
            Maglev has become a significant technology in countries like Japan and China, which have produced trains both for high-speed travel and low-speed efficient shuttling. However, the US has seen little success, which speaks to the limitations of train travel within the US and the speed at which new technologies are shared globally. Defining this concept of moving ideas across countries as “kinetic”, the flow of technology has become far more kinetic in recent years. For instance, the Japanese prime minister proposed selling their Maglev technology to the US to create a train line between NYC and Washington DC. However, this movement was limited by pushback from politicians, lobbyists, and corporations, who slowed the movement and “kinetics” of ideas. By contrasting this modern innovation with early railroads, it's clear that technological progress has been very “kinetic”, despite the many forces put against it.

          Conclusion
        </h2>

        <p className={styles.body}>
          The word “kinetic” has been displayed in four different ways within this exhibit, ranging from physical reactions to large-scale social movements. The link between all these “kinetics” is a degree of human control.  In the driving out of Chinese railroad workers, their path was defined by white bosses and the human society surrounding them. Within Buster Keaton’s physical comedy, he expresses full control over the kinetic energy he portrays. Within Calder’s sculpted mobiles, he uses human mechanics to connect his art with the physical forces of nature. Finally, the production of Maglev trains demonstrates the height of technological innovation in controlling kinetic energy as we understand it.
          <br /><br />
          However, influencing this control are various natural forces that balance against human creations. These forces can be other people, limiting projects, innovation, movement, or growth due to cost and labor. Nature itself impacts how far we can move with “kinetics”, like with the wilderness or the physical concept of friction. However, despite this constant balancing act of human and natural forces, technological innovation has continued to be “kinetic”, advancing through history.
          <br /><br />
          This exhibit ultimately returns back to the railroad, a constant symbol of forward-moving kinetic energy. As humans progress in art, film, science, and society, we push back against these competing forces and forge a way forward, much like the train first did. Thus, we are always striving to be “kinetic”.
